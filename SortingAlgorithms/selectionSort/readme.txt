Note:
we take the first element and set it as our min element(index) then we go through other elements and check if those elements
are smaller than our current min element, if it's not we go on, if it is then our min element is that index.
at the end we check if our min element is not as the same as I, because if it is, that element is in the right place
if it's not then we swap them.
